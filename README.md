### Features Left to Implement
#### Script
- A function to assign all of the user input words to variables, so that they can be used in the functions which generate the story.
- Some generic words assigned to the necessary variables by default, to be displayed if the user fails to input anything.
- A function which will check which story the user has selected, and fill the story area with the relevant story. An error alert should be displayed if the user has not selected a story.
